                    <h2>Rawad Himo, PhD</h2>
                    <p>Rawad Himo is a research scientist and engineer.</p>
                    <p>He first graduated with a Mechanical engineering degree from Notre Dame University, Lb with the highest distinction in 2017. Subsequently he pursued a PhD in planetary science in the University of Nantes, Fr where he also taught master courses on the finite element method and computational approaches. In his PhD, he was studying and computing the geodynamics that allow habitable conditions on high pressure ice moons such as Titan and Ganymede, in addition to computing geodynamics of Europa's ice shell, the PhD manuscript is available <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357749176_Exchange_processes_occurring_in_the_deep_icy_layers_of_water-rich_bodies_icy_moons_An_experimental_approach_by_similitude_analysis_and_numerical_modeling" style="color:#2AACAF;">online</a>, entitled "Exchange processes occurring in the deep icy layers of water-rich bodies (ice satellites): An experimental approach by similitude analysis and numerical modeling". A 45 minute presentation of the PhD dissertation is also available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LznMh82lxs" style="color:#2AACAF;">youtube</a>.</p>
                    <p>Today he is working in Norway as a research scientist and engineer in a private company on fluid mechanics, phase change, magnetohydrodynamics, electrochemistry and fluid mechanics.</p>
                    <p>Rawad Himo has several published peer reviewed articles and conferences proceedings on planterary science, magnetohydrodynamics, phase change, chaos and instabilities, aerodynamics and classical fields like heat transfer, fluid mechanics and structural mechanics, (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WPziaecAAAAJ&hl=en" style="color:#2AACAF;">link to google scholar</a>). However, he's recently leaning towards the opinion that only novel work should be published and hopes that the <i>publish or perish</i> culture in the academic world stops soon, as it is diluting and reducing the quality of scientific research.</p>
                    <p>His main passion is philosophy and the ideas presented in the essay were first conceived at the age of 16. </p>
